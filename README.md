# Terraria Border Utility
A Utility for creating outlines of tiles procedualy for tmodloader. Saving time copy and pasting. I created this program mainly because I was to lazy to copy and paste them manualy while making my own mod. There may be another program that already does this but I could not find one. Hopfuly it can save you time as well.
# Use
The program creates a spritesheet for framed tiles instead of having to create each tile manualy.<br>
